# AI Tribes

An interactive chart that lets you discover your AI tribe! Place yourself on a 2x2 matrix based on your views on AI development speed and power.

The four tribes are:

- **Techno-optimist**: "Leave us alone, everything will be fine"
- **E/ACC**: "Build the machine god" - pro-acceleration
- **Safetyist**: "Regulate to require safety and anti-bias"
- **Doomer**: "Slow down capabilities research"

## Group-Specific Links

You can create group-specific links so each group sees only their own pins. A badge below the title shows which group they're in.
